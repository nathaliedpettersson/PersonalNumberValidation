# Personal Number Validation

## A school assignment in C# where I implemented the following features:

- Use Windows Forms
- Create a menu and have two options - Register or Exit
- Add a person by firstname, lastname and personal number
- Have a method that controls if it is a valid Swedish personal number
- Determine whether it is a man or a woman based on the second last digit
